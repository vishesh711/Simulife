## API Key Configuration

### For Development (No API Keys Needed)
The system uses `MockLLMProvider` by default - provides template-based intelligent responses without requiring any external APIs.

### For Production LLM Integration
Set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
# OR
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-key"
```

Configure in agent creation:
```python
# OpenAI integration
agent.llm_brain = LLMAgentBrain(agent, OpenAIProvider())

# Groq integration  
agent.llm_brain = LLMAgentBrain(agent, GroqProvider())

# Development mode (no keys needed)
agent.llm_brain = LLMAgentBrain(agent, MockLLMProvider())
```
