## Primary Documentation Files

### üìã DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md (Root Directory)
The **master document** tracking all completed phases, accomplishments, test results, and current system status. This is your go-to file for understanding what SimuLife can do right now.

**Contents:**
- Phase-wise completion status
- Major feature accomplishments  
- Test results and metrics
- Current capabilities overview
- API key configuration guide
- Next development priorities

### üöÄ QUICK_START_GUIDE.md (Root Directory)  
Immediate setup instructions for new users. Shows how to run SimuLife **without any API keys** and optionally add them later.

**Contents:**
- 5-minute setup process
- API-free operation explanation
- Sample commands and expected results
- LLM provider configuration options

### üìù phases/PHASE_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md
Standardized template for documenting each development phase. Use this when completing new phases to maintain consistent documentation quality.

**Sections:**
- Phase goals and success criteria
- Technical accomplishments
- Test results and metrics
- Integration verification
- Issues encountered and resolved
- API key dependencies
- Next phase prerequisites

## Documentation Workflow

### For Completed Phases
1. ‚úÖ Already documented in `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
2. üìÅ Can optionally create detailed phase files in `docs/phases/` using the template

### For New Phase Development

1. **Phase Planning**
   - Copy `phases/PHASE_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md` 
   - Rename to `phase_X_name.md`
   - Fill out goals and success criteria

2. **During Development**
   - Update accomplishments as features are implemented
   - Record test results after each milestone
   - Document issues and resolutions

3. **Phase Completion**
   - Complete all template sections
   - Update `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` with phase summary
   - Archive phase documentation

4. **Quality Check**
   - Verify all features work as documented
   - Ensure API key dependencies are clear
   - Check that documentation matches actual implementation

## Documentation Standards

### ‚úÖ Good Documentation
- **Specific**: "Agents can form relationships with strength values 0.0-1.0"
- **Measurable**: "7-day simulation with 5 agents, 56 memories accumulated"  
- **Actionable**: "Run `python main.py` then type `run 1`"
- **Results-focused**: "Advanced events triggered including mentorship formation"

### ‚ùå Avoid
- Vague statements: "Agents work well"
- Missing metrics: "Some tests passed"
- Incomplete instructions: "Set up the environment"
- Outdated information: Always verify current state

## API Key Documentation Policy

Every major feature should clearly specify:
- **Development mode**: How it works without API keys
- **Production mode**: What API keys are needed for enhanced functionality
- **Configuration**: How to set up and switch between providers
- **Fallbacks**: What happens when API calls fail

## Documentation Maintenance

### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Verify `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` reflects current system state
- [ ] Check that Quick Start Guide commands still work
- [ ] Update completion percentages for in-progress phases

### After Each Phase
- [ ] Update master documentation
- [ ] Archive phase-specific documentation
- [ ] Verify all links and references work
- [ ] Test setup instructions on clean environment

### Before Major Releases
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation review
- [ ] User testing of setup instructions
- [ ] API key configuration verification
- [ ] Performance metrics validation

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new features:

1. **Update immediately**: Don't wait until "later" - document as you build
2. **Include examples**: Show real commands, real output, real results
3. **Test instructions**: Verify setup steps work on clean systems
4. **Explain trade-offs**: Why did you make specific technical decisions?

## Future Documentation Plans

As SimuLife grows, we may add:

- `docs/api/` - Code API documentation
- `docs/tutorials/` - Step-by-step feature tutorials  
- `docs/architecture/` - Detailed system design documents
- `docs/research/` - AI behavior analysis and insights
- `docs/deployment/` - Production deployment guides

## Getting Help

- **Quick questions**: Check `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` first
- **Setup issues**: Follow `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` 
- **Development process**: Use `phases/PHASE_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Code questions**: All modules have comprehensive docstrings

Remember: Good documentation makes SimuLife accessible to new contributors and helps future you understand past decisions! üìö‚ú®
